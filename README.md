# 🤖 Smart Lead AI

**AI-powered lead research and personalized outreach automation using advanced web scraping and generative AI.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Smart Lead AI automates the lead research and outreach workflow. Traditional lead research is time-consuming and repetitive—visiting websites, gathering business information, analyzing company operations, and crafting personalized cold emails. 

Smart Lead AI solves this by automating the entire pipeline:

1. **Extract** — Scrapes comprehensive website data (title, meta description, body content)
2. **Analyze** — Uses Google Gemini AI to understand the business and identify pain points
3. **Generate** — Creates personalized, compelling cold email pitches tailored to each prospect
4. **Store** — Saves lead intelligence to Google Sheets for CRM integration and team collaboration

The result: lead research that used to take 15-20 minutes per company is now completed in under 60 seconds.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🌐 Website Data Extraction
Smart Lead AI uses **Playwright** (a modern browser automation framework) to scrape websites with JavaScript rendering support. The scraper:
- Launches a headless Chrome browser
- Waits for network requests to complete before extracting data
- Captures page title, meta description, and full visible text content
- Handles network failures and timeouts gracefully
- Limits extracted content to prevent oversized payloads

### 🤖 AI-Powered Lead Analysis & Email Generation
Powered by **Google Gemini 3.6 Flash**, the AI engine:
- Analyzes scraped website content to understand the business model
- Generates a 2-sentence company summary
- Identifies a specific pain point or growth opportunity
- Writes a compelling 3-sentence personalized cold email pitch
- Executes with low latency for real-time feedback

The AI uses carefully engineered prompts positioning the LLM as a "world-class B2B sales expert" to ensure high-quality output.

### ✉️ Personalized Email Generation
Rather than generic templates, Smart Lead AI generates emails that:
- Reference specific details from the prospect's website
- Demonstrate research and understanding of their business
- Identify potential pain points in their industry/operations
- Present a compelling value proposition
- Follow sales best practices (short, conversational, action-oriented)

### 📊 Google Sheets Integration
Lead data is automatically saved to Google Sheets with:
- **URL** — Target website
- **Title** — Page title/company name
- **Meta Description** — Company description
- **AI Analysis & Pitch** — Full AI-generated summary and email

Authentication uses Google service account credentials (OAuth 2.0) for secure API access. Teams can share a single sheet and see all researched leads in real-time.

### ⚡ Automated Workflow
The complete pipeline runs seamlessly:
- User provides a website URL via Streamlit UI
- Website data is extracted automatically
- AI processes the data and generates analysis
- Results are displayed instantly
- User can download as CSV or save to Google Sheets
- Full process completes in under 60 seconds

## 🧠 AI Processing

Smart Lead AI leverages **Google Gemini 3.6 Flash** (a frontier-grade generative AI model) for fast, accurate business analysis.

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

The AI engine uses a carefully crafted system prompt that positions the model as a "world-class B2B sales expert." This priming:
- Ensures sales-focused analysis over generic summaries
- Improves personalization and relevance of cold emails
- Encourages identification of genuine business pain points
- Results in higher open rates and response rates on generated emails

### Input to AI

The prompt sends:
- **Website URL** — Reference point for context
- **Page Title** — Company/service name
- **Meta Description** — Official company tagline
- **First 1500 Characters** — Body content (web content, products, services)

### AI Output

The model generates structured analysis:
1. **Summary** — Exactly 2 sentences explaining what the company does
2. **Pain Point** — Specific identified opportunity or challenge
3. **Personalized Email** — Exactly 3-sentence cold email pitch

### Processing & Validation

- Response text is stripped of extra whitespace
- Output is returned as plain text (not requiring JSON parsing in current version)
- Errors are caught and displayed to user without crashing the application

### Why Gemini 3.6 Flash?

- **Speed** — Ultra-low latency for real-time UI feedback (~2-3 seconds per lead)
- **Accuracy** — Strong performance on business analysis and sales writing tasks
- **Cost** — Token-efficient pricing for high-volume lead research
- **Quality** — Produces professional, compelling cold emails

### Expected Output Example

```
URL: https://example.com
Title: Example Domain
Meta Description: Illustration domain for documents
AI Analysis & Pitch:

1. **Summary:** Example.com provides a reference domain for illustrative purposes in technical documentation and internet standards. It's used globally as a standard placeholder for examples and demonstrations.

2. **Pain Point:** As a non-commercial informational domain, Example.com lacks monetization opportunities and advanced feature development that could enhance its utility for developers and technical writers.

3. **Personalized Email Pitch:** I noticed Example.com is the go-to reference domain for millions of developers worldwide. Could we explore creating premium documentation templates or certification programs to unlock new revenue streams? I'd love to discuss how we could help make Example.com even more valuable for your global audience.
